       We work in an environment where it matters to make the right design decisions the first time, and as a result, take on less technical debt than other companies.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We believe in two equal track career growths between senior individual contributors and managers. We want people to contribute where they feel most impactful.

       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       People have a strong sense of ownership and accountability for what they're building. What we build today will be the foundation for dozens of other designs in the future.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       <br/>
       We are very frank on discussing technical matters. If one disagrees with how things are being done, we encourage them to speak up and help us get to the truth faster.
