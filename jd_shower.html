       Do you believe that creators should have the ability to get paid for the value they give to their fans?
       <br/>
       We do, which is why we're building Patreon, a platform that powers membership services for creators with established followings. Patreon strives to provide creators with insight, education, and tools that make it possible to retain creative control while running their creative business, so creators can focus on making their art, music, podcasts, and more.
       <br/>
       Our user base has doubled in the last year alone, and we have paid over $1 billion directly to creators on our platform. In order to support this level of growth, Patreon is looking for a Staff Product Designer.
